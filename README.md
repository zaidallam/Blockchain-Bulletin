## About The Project

This is a concept dApp that allows users to participate in mass, decentralized communication through a channel-based bulletin board. The bulletin board is comprised of customizable channels, which are, in turn, comprised of posts that contain a title, message, and even resource URL. The project features a basic permissions system that dictates which accounts are allowed to modify certain data, including channels, posts, and even other address' permissions. 
This is a two-page concept project that was built using several fameworks and libraries, including but not limited to the Truffle Suite, Ethers, Next, and Tailwind.
The project is meant to showcase how smart contracts may be used manage a bulletin board in a decentralized manner. This means that, as far as the UI goes, it is still missing some polishing such as loading animations, double-request protection, input validation, and other similar features. These features were deemed unnecessary for the purposes of this concept project. That said, the project still has an aesthetic but simple frontend.
This project and its code were engineered solely by Zaid Allam.
